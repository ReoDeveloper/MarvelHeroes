# MarvelHeroes

### Introduction

Android project for practicing clean architecture principles. I tried to follow Fernando Cejas approach as shown on his [repository](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture), unit testing and kotlin.

### Main goal
Create a master-detail Android application that lists your favorite character’s comics:
- The master scene will display all the comics for the character, where each cell will display the comic’s title and thumbnail image.
- The detail screen will display a random image for the selected comic, along with the title and the description of the comic (or any other relevant information you want).
- Use the Marvel Public API http://developer.marvel.com/docs in order to fetch your character’s comics.

#### Special detail on
-  Project architecture
-  Design Patterns
-  Best practices
